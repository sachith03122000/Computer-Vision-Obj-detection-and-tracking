# Computer-Vision-Obj-detection-and-tracking

#• Developed Python code for object detection and tracking using CCTV footage, with and without pre-trained models.
#• Utilized YOLO, OpenCV, and NMS to implement the task effectively.
#• Looked into different approaches, made algorithms, and fixed technical problems like contours that overlapped. To fix these
problems, NMS was put in place and contours covering less than 50% were ignored.
#• Successfully created a robust system for object detection and tracking, improving computer vision skills and contributing
to real-world applications.
